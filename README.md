# The Social Company

Everything you need to build on social media.

There are four tools in this repository:

- [Odkryj](/apps/odkryj/README.md) - Find trends on social media.
- [Istota](/apps/istota/README.md) - Create content for social media.
- [Sotsial](/apps/sotsial/README.md) - Publish to all social media platforms.
- [Zroby](/apps/zroby/README.md) - A personal assistant for social media.

All of these tools are API-first (except for Zroby, which is a web app).

## Why open-source?

I hate how most social media tools are proprietary when they are, in fact, so simple â€” so I built them.
